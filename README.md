# HTML Email

For this assignment you are going to create an email, similiar to one of Mr. Blank's emails that he sends on a regular basis, just plain text and no style. As a suggestion, a Halloween themed email might be fun. ðŸ’€ðŸ‘»ðŸŽƒðŸ¦‡

## Submission
You will submit your email twice.
1. Make sure all your files are uploaded here on GitHub.
2. You will email me, ikilpatrick@schools.nyc.gov, your finished email.  

Due Date: TBD

## Step 1
### Research
- What is an html email?
- What do they look like? (You probably recieve multiple a day, check your inbox)
- What are similar or common traits you see across various emails?
- What features do they have?
- What is the "goal" of each email you looked at? **The goal is the key!**

## Step 2
### Learning
- How do you make an html email? (More info below)
- Am I able to send one? Create a basic email and send it to yourself.
- How do I use html and css to create this type of email? (More info below)

## Step 3
### Planning
- This is the most important time.  
- What is your email going to look like?  
- What is the theme, the purpose, the content?  
- What colors, borders, fonts, etc. are you going to use?  
- The more time you spend on this step, the easier the next step will be.  
- Use Figma/Canva to create a prototype of your email, focus on the details and the layout.

## Step 4
### Coding
If you did a thorough job on step 3, you should be able to jump right in to coding.
Start writing html and css. Take your time, check as you go (use those two screens!), debug, do peer reviews, etc.

## Tips
### Inline your CSS before sending

Email is notorious for inconsistent CSS support. Therefore you should always inline your CSS and send a test to yourself before sending.

## Images in email

When inserting images remember to include the following attributes or risk them breaking in different clients:

* `src`
* `alt`
* `width`
* `height`
* `border`

Example:

`<img src="https://absolute-path-to-image.jpg" alt="Useful alt text" width="500" height="300" border="0" style="border:0; outline:none; text-decoration:none; display:block;">`
